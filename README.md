# Cancer-Associated VTE Decision Aid

**An interactive, client-side web application for exploring cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk factors.**

This project is a lightweight Next.js application providing educational and research-oriented information on cancer-associated VTE. It uses modern web technologies (React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS) to deliver interactive content (buttons, dropdowns, diagrams) without requiring user accounts or storing any Protected Health Information (PHI).

> ⚠️ **Important:** This software is intended for research use only. It must not be used in real-world medical or clinical decision-making settings.
